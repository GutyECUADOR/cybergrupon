                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>At CyberGroupOn.com, when you purchase advertising packages, the entire cost is distributed among all participants in the program.

                    <p>Irrespective of the size of the advertising package each advertiser has, they all have an equal probability of their ads being shown.

The only difference is that a larger package will have a longer duration based on the available number of exposures.</p>
